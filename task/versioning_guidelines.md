# Versioning Guidelines

## Overview

This document provides guidelines for version management of MODs and projects.

## Version Number Format

- Use the `v1.0.0` format for version numbers.
- Version numbers consist of three parts: major, minor, and patch.
- Increment the major version when making incompatible changes.
- Increment the minor version when adding or modifying features.
- Increment the patch version when fixing bugs.

## Version Tags

- Use Git tags to manage versions at the time of release.
- Tag names should be prefixed with `v` followed by the version number (e.g., `v1.0.0`).

## Version Change Log

- Record version change logs in the `CHANGELOG.md` file.
- The change log should record added, changed, fixed, and removed features.
