# Efficient Tool Selection Guidelines

## Overview

This document provides guidelines for selecting the most efficient tools based on the task content.

## Guidelines

- Select the most efficient tool (e.g., `sed`, `awk`, `find`) based on the task content.
- Example: Consider using the `sed` command when making the same changes to a large number of files.
- Example: Use the `find` command to search for file names or files with specific patterns.
- Example: Use the `awk` command for text extraction and transformation.

## Rules

- Consider using the `sed` command when making the same changes to a large number of files.
- Use the `find` command to search for file names or files with specific patterns.
- Use the `awk` command for text extraction and transformation.
- By using these tools, you can improve the efficiency of your work.

## Best Practices

- When using `sed` for bulk file editing, create a backup of the original files.
- Use `find` in combination with `sed` to apply changes to multiple files that match a specific pattern.
- When using `awk`, write the script in a separate file for complex transformations to improve readability and maintainability.
- Always test your scripts on a small set of files before applying them to a large number of files.
