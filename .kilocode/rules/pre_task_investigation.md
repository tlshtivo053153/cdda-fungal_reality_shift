# Pre-Task Investigation Rule

## Overview

This document defines the rule for conducting thorough investigations before implementing new features or definitions. This ensures that existing patterns and rules are understood and followed, leading to higher quality code.

## Pre-Task Investigation Process

1.  **Review Existing Implementations**: Before adding new features or definitions, search for and review existing similar implementations to understand the patterns and rules being used.
2.  **Document Findings**: Keep a record of the patterns, rules, and supported targets identified during the investigation. This documentation can be useful for future reference and for other team members.
3.  **Use Findings as a Base**: Use the findings from the investigation as a base for the new implementation.

## Benefits

- Reduces the risk of implementing features that do not conform to existing patterns.
- Ensures consistency with the existing codebase.
- Improves overall code quality and maintainability.
