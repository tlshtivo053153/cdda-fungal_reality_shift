# Pre-Task Investigation Guidelines

## Overview

This document provides guidelines for conducting thorough investigations before implementing new features or definitions.

## Pre-Task Investigation Process

1. **Review Existing Implementations**: Before adding new features or definitions, investigate existing similar implementations to understand the patterns and rules being used.
2. **Identify Supported Targets**: Clearly identify the supported targets (e.g., terrain types, item types) by examining existing files. This helps prevent the inclusion of unsupported elements.
3. **Document Findings**: Keep a record of the patterns, rules, and supported targets identified during the investigation. This documentation can be useful for future reference and for other team members.

## Benefits

- Reduces the risk of implementing unsupported features.
- Ensures consistency with existing codebase patterns.
- Improves overall code quality and maintainability.
