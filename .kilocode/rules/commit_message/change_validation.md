# Change Validation Guidelines

## Overview

This document provides guidelines for validating changes to ensure they are applied correctly.

## Guidelines

- Always validate changes after they are made.
- Use tools like `rg` to confirm that changes have been applied as expected.
- Example: After replacing `t_gasoline` with `t_liquid_fuel`, use `rg t_gasoline` to ensure no instances remain.

## Rules

- Validate changes using appropriate tools.
- Confirm that the intended changes have been applied and that no unintended changes have occurred.
- Document the validation process and results.
