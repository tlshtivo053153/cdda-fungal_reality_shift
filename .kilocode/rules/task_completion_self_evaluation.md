# Task Completion Self-Evaluation Guidelines

## Overview

This document provides guidelines for conducting self-evaluations after completing tasks. The purpose is to improve the quality of work and identify areas for improvement.

## Task Completion Self-Evaluation

### When to Conduct Self-Evaluation
- Conduct a self-evaluation immediately after completing a task.
- Ensure that the task has been fully completed before starting the evaluation.

### Self-Evaluation Items
- **Goal Achievement**: Was the task's goal achieved?
- **Quality Standards**: Do the code or documentation meet the quality standards?
- **Time Management**: Was the time spent on the task appropriate?
- **Collaboration**: Was collaboration with other team members effective?

### How to Conduct Self-Evaluation
1. Review the task requirements and ensure all objectives have been met.
2. Evaluate the quality of the work produced.
3. Assess the time spent on the task and identify any inefficiencies.
4. Reflect on collaboration with team members and identify areas for improvement.

## Improvement Based on Feedback

### Identifying Improvement Points
- Based on the self-evaluation results, identify specific areas for improvement.
- Document these improvement points clearly.

### Adding or Modifying Rules
