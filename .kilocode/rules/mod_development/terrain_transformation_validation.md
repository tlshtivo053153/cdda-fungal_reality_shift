# Terrain Transformation Validation Guidelines

## Overview

This document provides guidelines for validating terrain transformation definitions in MOD development.

## Terrain Transformation Validation

- When modifying `ter_furn_transform` definitions, ensure that the `result` field includes all appropriate terrain types.
- Before making changes, review the existing terrain types in the base game to ensure compatibility.
- Use the debug menu to test terrain transformations in-game to verify correctness.
