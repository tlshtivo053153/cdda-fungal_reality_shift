# Specification Confirmation Rule

## Overview

This document defines the rule for confirming specifications before implementing new features or definitions. This ensures that the implementation is accurate and meets the requirements.

## Specification Confirmation Process

1.  **List Required Specifications**: Clearly list all the specifications required for the implementation. This includes data structures, parameters, and behavioral requirements.
2.  **Verify Specifications**: Verify the listed specifications against official documentation, existing code, or other reliable sources.
3.  **Clarify Ambiguities**: If there are any ambiguities or unclear points, seek clarification from the user or other team members.
4.  **Proceed with Implementation**: Only proceed with the implementation after all specifications have been confirmed.

## Benefits

- Reduces the risk of implementing features that do not meet the requirements.
- Ensures that the implementation is accurate and reliable.
- Improves overall code quality and maintainability.
