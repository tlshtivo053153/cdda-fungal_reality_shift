# Post-Task Verification Guidelines

## Overview

This document provides guidelines for verifying task completion and ensuring alignment with user intent.

## Post-Task Verification Process

1. **Re-confirm User Intent**: After completing a task, re-read the original request and any subsequent feedback to ensure all requirements have been met.
2. **Check for Completeness**: Verify that all aspects of the task have been addressed, including any related changes in other files that might be affected.
3. **Validate Dependencies**: If the task involved changes to elements that are referenced by other parts of the codebase (e.g., EOCs, item definitions), ensure that these dependencies are still valid and correctly linked.
4. **Test Functionality**: If possible, test the implemented changes in the application context to confirm they work as expected.
5. **Review for Consistency**: Check that the new or modified code is consistent with the existing codebase in terms of style, naming conventions, and architectural patterns.

## Benefits

- Reduces the risk of missing requirements or incomplete implementations.
- Ensures that changes do not introduce new issues or break existing functionality.
- Improves overall code quality and maintainability.
