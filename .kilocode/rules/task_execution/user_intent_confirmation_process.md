# User Intent Confirmation Process

## Purpose
To establish a process for accurately understanding user intent and implementing appropriate solutions.

## Process
1. **Initial Assessment:** Upon receiving a task, first analyze the request and provided context to understand the user's intent.
2. **Clarification:** If the intent is unclear or ambiguous, ask the user questions with specific examples or suggestions.
3. **Confirmation:** Before making significant changes, confirm the approach with the user to ensure it aligns with their expectations.
4. **Feedback Integration:** Promptly incorporate user feedback and adjust the implementation as needed.

## Best Practices
- Prioritize understanding the user's intent over technical implementation details.
- Provide clear explanations of proposed solutions to ensure mutual understanding.
- Document any assumptions made during the task execution process.
