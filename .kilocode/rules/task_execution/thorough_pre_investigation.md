# Thorough Pre-Investigation

## Overview

This rule emphasizes the importance of conducting a detailed investigation of related files and directories at the beginning of a task to identify potential issues or additional work that might not be immediately obvious. This helps in creating a more accurate plan and prevents surprises during implementation.

## Purpose

- To prevent overlooking potential issues or additional work during the initial stages of a task.
- To improve the accuracy of task planning.
- To reduce the likelihood of encountering unexpected problems during implementation.

## Process

1.  **Detailed Investigation**: At the start of a task, conduct a thorough investigation of all related files and directories.
2.  **Identify Potential Issues**: Look for potential issues, hidden dependencies, or additional work that might not be immediately obvious from the initial task description.
3.  **Document Findings**: Record the findings of the investigation in a document and share it with team members.
4.  **Update Task Plan**: Based on the investigation, update the task plan to include any newly identified work or considerations.

## Benefits

- Reduces the risk of encountering unexpected issues during implementation.
- Improves the accuracy of task estimates and planning.
- Enhances overall task quality and reduces rework.
